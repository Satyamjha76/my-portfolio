        etc information about the enquiry, and pending payments in basic Excel sheets which are not that
         good looking or understandable by a different employee who will manage this data and also they are
          not managed properly because of that followup to the enquiry of customers are not done timely and 
          companies loses the orders. Here our project SalesSahayak Comes into play, it will store all enquiries 
          from customers, orders from customers, and pending payment orders. It will also store the contact 
          information of the customer/company. Thus on our website, an employee of that company can enter data 
          like new enquiries, new customers, regular orders which come without enquiry, pending payment etc. 
          However, this information will be different for every employee because every employee will be handling 
          different clients. The information on the enquiry, orders, and payments of all the employees will be visible 
          to the owner of the company with his/her special login account. 
            In this way, our website will help businesses to streamline their sales department.`,
