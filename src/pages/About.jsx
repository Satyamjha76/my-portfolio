      <p className='text-xl mt-5 underline underline-offset-4 font-medium'>My Journey of Becoming a Developer</p>
      <p className='text-lg mt-1 ml-1 font-normal'>üíª My coding journey began right after my 12th exams, 
        during the gap before college started. With a couple of months to spare and nothing much to do, I got 
        curious about programming and started exploring online. That‚Äôs when I discovered Java‚Äîdespite hearing 
        it was a tough language to begin with, I decided to go for it.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        I dove into free resources on YouTube and completed a full course before college even began. Interestingly, 
        I had tried learning Python during 12th grade, but couldn‚Äôt find the time to complete it. So, Java officially 
        became my first and favorite programming language‚ù§Ô∏è.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Once college started, I got to learn C, C++, JavaScript, CSS, DSA, ASP.NET, PHP, Android Development, and 
        Python. Each new language added a fresh perspective and pushed me further into the world of tech.
